#### courses
  
- **HPM 213: Public Health Law**
  *Spring 2020, Spring 2021: Teaching Assistant for Dr. Ameet Sarpatwari*
  This course provides students with an overview of public health law: what it is, why it matters to practitioners and providers, and how it can influence (positively or negatively) health outcomes. Key questions explored include: 1) What authority does the government have to regulate in the interest of public health?; 2) How are individual rights balanced against this authority?; 3) How can criminal statutes, civil litigation, and patent law be used to promote or harm public health? The course investigates these issues through real-world examples — HIV/AIDS, obesity, reproductive health, and lawsuits against tobacco and gun companies — while touching on constitutional, criminal, tort, and intellectual property law.

- **GHP 269: The Political Economy of Global Health** 
  *Spring 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020: Teaching Assistant for Dr. Jesse Bump*
  This course presents theoretical perspectives, empirical cases, and research issues in policy analysis and political economy in global health. The focus is on analytical and methodological issues, with an emphasis on political economy constraints on health initiatives and the roles of international agencies, NGOs, and the state.

- **SW 24: Is Globalization Good or Bad for World Health?**  
  *Spring 2019: Teaching Assistant for Dr. Sue Goldie*
  Three global trends — interconnectedness, shifting population dynamics, and evolving epidemiology — present both opportunities and risks for health. This course challenges assumptions and broadens perspectives on how health relates to sustainable development, examining 1) social, political, and environmental determinants of health; 3) transnational risks; and 3) solutions across disciplines, sectors, and levels of governance. Students gain a toolbox of qualitative and quantitative approaches to analyze global health challenges.

- **GHP 212: Political Economy of Health Sector Reform**  
  *Fall 2018, Fall 2019, Fall 2020: Teaching Assistant for Dr. Kevin Croke*  
  This seminar explores how political economy influences health systems in developing countries. Topics include 1) path dependency and institutional change; 2) political institutions (e.g., democracy vs. authoritarianism) and their influence on health reforms; and 3) state capacity and reform implementation. Students apply these theories using both causal inference and case study methods, developing their own political economy analyses of health reforms in countries of their choice.

- **GHP 244: Health Sector Reform: A Worldwide Perspective**  
  *Fall 2019: Teaching Assistant for Dr. Thomas Bossert*  
  This course offers an in-depth understanding of health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Students analyze health system objectives, financing, payment systems, decentralization, human resources, and technology transitions. The course includes lectures, case studies, and literature reviews, culminating in applied analyses of a chosen country’s health system.
