Hello! I am a health economist researching pharmaceutical markets at Médecins Sans Frontières and the Yale Collaboration for Regulatory Rigor, Integrity, and Transparency. I completed my PhD at Harvard University in 2023 and was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University 2023-2025.  My research crosses economics, political science, and law to better understand pharmaceutical markets and their relationship to public health.

I hold a PhD in Population Health Science (Health Systems) from Harvard University (2023) and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University (2023–2025).  My professional experience spans a range of global health institutions, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM), the World Bank, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the Ada Lovelace Institute, and the Addressing the Challenge and Constraints of Insulin Sources and Supply (ACCISS) study. My policy work, including Congressional testimony and public comments, is linked above.

Research interests: pharmaceutical policy, health economics, econometric methods, medicine affordability and availability, drug shortages, pharmaceutical manufacturing, public production, industrial and regulatory policy, competition and intellectual property law, political economy, global health history, biomedical R&D and innovation models
